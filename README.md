# Description #
Working on creating the basic repo needed for new grads in CS. You might not be asked to implement these functions but you should know them to solve a problem on an interview.

# What to expect#
* Binary Search Trees
  * insert (putting a node into your tree at the correct position)
  * delete (deleting a node and than repositioning the tree)
  * inOrder (traversing the binary through recursion and iteratively)
  * preOrder (traversing the binary through recursion and iteratively)
  * postOrder (traversing the binary through recursion)
  * getHeightOfNode (returns height of BST)
  * contains (checks whether a value exist in the tree recursion and iteratively)
  * levelOrderTraversal (prints nodes from top to bottom)
  * reverseLevelOrderTraversal (prints nodes from bottom to top)
  * printAtGivenLevel (prints nodes at given level)

* LinkedList (WIP)
  * Singly LinkedList
    * insertAt
    * insertAtEnd
    * size
    * deleteAt
    * get
    * reverse (linkedlist reverse inplace)

* Stack (Building a stack using arraylist)

* Stack (Building a stack using linkedlist)

More to come :)

# Code #
Done in java. I'm still working on adding some edge cases but for the most part these functions will work for most cases.

# Advice #
Start by picking a data structure. The IDE I used for this was Eclipse (Oxygen.3a Release (4.7.3a). Once you are able import the files and get it to run try debugging one function call at a time to understand whats working under the hood.  http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~kaharris/10200/tutorials/eclipse/import.html
